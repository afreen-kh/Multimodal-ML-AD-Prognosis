# Model Comparison

A comprehensive comparison of multiple supervised machine learning classifiers was conducted to evaluate their suitability for Alzheimer’s disease prognosis. The evaluated models span linear, probabilistic, tree-based, ensemble, and neural network approaches.

Comparative analysis focused on classification accuracy, robustness, and consistency across validation folds. Ensemble-based models, particularly Random Forest, demonstrated superior generalization performance relative to individual classifiers.

The comparison highlights that algorithmic complexity alone does not guarantee improved prognostic capability; rather, effective integration of multi-modal features plays a decisive role in performance.

# Model Training and Validation

Model training was conducted using a supervised learning framework aimed at binary classification of Alzheimer’s disease status. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained independently to assess their predictive capability across different learning paradigms.

Cross-validation was employed to mitigate overfitting and to obtain reliable performance estimates. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to identify optimal model configurations that balance bias and variance.

Model validation focused on generalization performance using unseen data, ensuring that predictive accuracy was not confined to the training subset. This systematic training and validation strategy supports robust and clinically meaningful prognostic modeling.

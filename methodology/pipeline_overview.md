# Multi-Modal Prognostic Pipeline Overview

This study proposes a structured multi-modal machine learning pipeline for the prognosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The pipeline integrates neuroimaging-derived features with cognitive assessment scores to support early and reliable disease prognosis.

The methodology is organized into five sequential stages: data preparation, data segregation, model training, prediction, and performance evaluation. Each stage is designed to ensure methodological transparency, robustness, and clinical relevance.

By combining heterogeneous data modalities within a unified analytical framework, the proposed pipeline enables effective learning of complex relationships between anatomical brain measures and cognitive decline indicators.

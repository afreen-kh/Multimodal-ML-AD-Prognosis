# Dataset Description

The dataset used in this study was obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), a publicly available neuroimaging resource designed to support research on aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

The dataset includes structural MRI-derived anatomical measures alongside demographic and neuropsychological attributes. MRI scans were acquired using standardized protocols, ensuring consistency across subjects.

Key variables include age, gender, education level, socioeconomic status, MMSE score, CDR score, estimated total intracranial volume, normalized whole brain volume, and atlas scaling factor.

All data usage adheres to OASIS data access policies. No raw imaging files or subject-level records are distributed through this repository.
